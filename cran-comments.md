By accident, the last upload (5.5.0) contained a custom DESCRIPTION-entry "ValidationKey". This has been removed in the new upload (5.5.1). Please ignore the last upload and use version 5.5.1 instead.

This version fixes errors which occured with recent R-devel versions caused by a more restrictive behavior of the "dim<-" function.

In addition, the package comes with various improvements. Most notably, a streamlined routine to expand magclass objects relative to a reference object.
