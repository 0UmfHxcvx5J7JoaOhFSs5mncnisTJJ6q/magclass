Version jumps in minor (submitted: 4.107.0, existing: 4.51.1)

## Explanation

We managed to fix the problems of the last submission (unknown DESCRIPTION field and CITATION file which was not working before installation).

The jump in version is intended. The package is currently developed quite quickly and we wanted to avoid spamming CRAN daily with new versions.
